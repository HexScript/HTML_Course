🚀 My HTML Learning Repository
👋 Welcome!

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing HTML. It serves as a personal workspace and portfolio where I store, test, and document my progress in mastering the fundamentals of web development.

🎯 Repository Goal

The primary goal of this repo is simple:

    Learn HTML5's syntax, structure, and best practices.

    Keep my small examples and projects in one place.

    Track my learning and see how I improve.

📚 What You'll Find Inside

This repository primarily contains:

    Basic Examples: Files demonstrating core HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, etc.).

    Structural Practice: Projects focusing on proper document structure (using <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, etc.).

    Form Practice: Examples of creating various input types and forms.

    Learning Notes: Occasionally, I'll include simple text notes on concepts I'm currently studying.

Happy HTML Coding!
