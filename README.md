🚀 My HTML Learning Journey Repository
👋 Welcome!

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It serves as a personal workspace and portfolio where I store, test, and document my progress in mastering the fundamentals of web development.
🎯 Repository Goal

The primary goal of this repo is simple:

    To systematically learn the syntax, structure, and best practices of HTML5.

    To house small, focused examples and projects I create during my learning process.

    To track my understanding and growth over time.

📚 What You'll Find Inside

This repository primarily contains:

    Basic Examples: Files demonstrating core HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, etc.).

    Structural Practice: Projects focusing on proper document structure (using <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, etc.).

    Form Practice: Examples of creating various input types and forms.

    Learning Notes: Occasionally, I'll include simple text notes on concepts I'm currently studying.

Happy Coding!
